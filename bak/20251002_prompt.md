I'm resuming a project where I was working with ChatGPT to update a self-contained HTML web app that performs X25519 Diffie-Hellman key exchange using Mnemonicode.

The app generates public/private keypairs, encodes them as 24-word mnemonics, allows voice-based public key sharing, and computes a 12-word shared secret. We already use `noble-curves.js`, `mnemonic.js`, and a local `mn_words.js`.

We previously discussed three main improvements:
1. Streamline the layout for desktop and mobile (responsive, user-friendly "card" layout)
2. Add beginner-friendly explanations of how key exchange works and why it's secure over untrusted channels
3. Replace the dropdown-based input of partner key words with autocompleting text inputs using the mnemonicode wordlist.

At this point in the project:
- We decided on a new layout with card-style sections for each phase: intro, keypair generation, partner key input, shared secret.
- The user prefers dark mode by default with light mode toggle.
- Keyboard accessibility is not a priority.
- The Awesomplete library has already been downloaded and is available locally (alongside the HTML file).
- We're about to begin **Phase 1: Implementing the new layout** based on a mockup ChatGPT previously provided.

Please continue by implementing the new layout into a fully responsive HTML file, using local references only. Assume that awesomplete.min.js and awesomplete.css are in a sibling directory named `awesomplete-gh-pages`.
